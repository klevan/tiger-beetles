Using rvest package to scrape species checklists from USGS to get species tables

The R code provided will take species lists for each county and compile then into a table with species names along the top and state and county information going down the rows for each species.

Some of the sites were in a weird format, so I can't guarantee that just hitting ctrl+R is going to give you the exact same result in one go. However, I've provided the output data that were generated, so you could just play with that if you wanted to.
